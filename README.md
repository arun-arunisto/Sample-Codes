# Sample-Codes
Functions that i used for my projects
1. Number letter separator from a string

            if the word/string like this 
                  "127a301d101"
            and i want results like
                  "127,a,301,d,101"
                  or
                  "127:a:301:d:101"
                  or
                  "127-a-301-d-101"
            
            like this cases we are going to use this function
            
above code i use "," so you need to change the sign for your code!!!

            change the code where
                        "result = ",".join(result)"
                        to
                        "result = ":".join(result)"
